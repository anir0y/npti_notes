**Installation:**
DIE : https://github.com/horsicq/DIE-engine/releases/download/3.09/die_win64_portable_3.09_x64.zip


There are two main ways to install YARA on Windows:

1. **Manual Download:**
    
    - Visit the YARA project on GitHub ([https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)).
    - Download the appropriate installer (32-bit or 64-bit) for your system.
    - Unzip the downloaded archive.
    - Extract the `yara.exe` and `yarac.exe` files to a directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\Yara`).
    - **Optional:** Add the directory containing the YARA executables to your system's PATH environment variable for easier access from the command line.
2. **Package Managers (Not officially maintained):**
    
    - You can also try using package managers like Scoop or Chocolatey, but keep in mind that these integrations are not officially maintained by the YARA team.
    - Use commands like `scoop install yara` or `choco install yara` at your own discretion.

**Using YARA:**

YARA operates from the command line. Here's a basic workflow:

1. **Create or Obtain YARA Rules:**
    
    - You can find YARA rules online for detecting specific malware families or characteristics.
    - Alternatively, you can write your own YARA rules using a text editor. Refer to the YARA documentation for syntax details ([https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)).
    - we will be using our own rules here [[1.2.1. Yara in windows]]
1. **Compile the Rules (Optional):**
    
    - While not strictly necessary, compiling your YARA rules with `yarac.exe` can improve performance for repeated scans.
    - Example: `yarac --outfile my_rule.yar my_rule.txt`
3. **Scan Files:**
    
    - Use `yara.exe` to scan files against your rules.
        
    - Example: `yara.exe my_rule.yar suspicious_file.exe`
        
    - If a match is found, YARA will display the rule name and the scanned file name.
        

**Example with a Simple Rule:**

Let's say you have a YARA rule named `is_pe.yara` that detects Portable Executable (PE) files. You can download a simple example rule from VirusTotal ([https://github.com/InQuest/yara-rules/blob/master/PE.rule](https://github.com/InQuest/yara-rules/blob/master/PE.rule)):

```
rule Exe_Detector
{
	meta:
		description = "PE file 'MZ' header as string"
		author = "Animesh Roy"

	strings:
		$pe = "MZ"

	condition:
		$pe at 0
}
```

1. Download `is_pe.yara` and save it in the same directory as your `yara.exe`.
2. Run the scan: `yara.exe is_pe.yara example.exe` (Replace `example.exe` with the file you want to scan)

**Additional Tips:**

- Explore YARA's command-line options for more control over scanning (e.g., `-r` for recursive directory scans).
- Consider integrating YARA with other security tools for automated analysis.
- Remember that YARA is just one tool in your malware analysis arsenal. Combine it with other techniques for a comprehensive approach.
