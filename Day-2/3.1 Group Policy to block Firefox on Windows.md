   - Right-click on "Additional Rules" and select "New Path Rule".

4. **Set the Path Rule:**

   - Set the "Security level" to "Disallowed".
   - Click "OK".

#### Option 2: Using AppLocker (Available in Enterprise and Education editions)

### Step 5: Update Group Policy

1. **Force Group Policy Update:**
   - Open a Command Prompt on a client machine and type `gpupdate /force` to force the policy update.

### Step 6: Verify the Policy

1. **Test on Client Machine:**
   - Try to run Firefox on a client machine within the scope of the GPO.
   - You should receive an error message indicating that the application is blocked.

### Additional Notes

- **Exceptions:** If you need to allow Firefox for certain users, create a separate GPO for those users or modify the security filtering on the existing GPO.
- **Path Variations:** Ensure you cover both possible installation paths for 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
