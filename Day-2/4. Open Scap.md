Sure! Here’s a step-by-step tutorial for using OpenSCAP and SCAP Workbench for configuration auditing:

## Introduction

**OpenSCAP** is an open-source framework that provides a standardized approach for maintaining the security of enterprise systems, such as vulnerability management, security configuration auditing, and patch management. **SCAP Workbench** is a graphical utility that offers an easy-to-use interface for working with OpenSCAP.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing OpenSCAP and SCAP Workbench, and using them to perform a configuration audit on a Linux system.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system (e.g., CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Ubuntu)
- Root or sudo access

## Step 1: Installing OpenSCAP

### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

```bash
sudo yum install openscap openscap-scanner scap-security-guide
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install libopenscap8 scap-workbench
```

## Step 2: Installing SCAP Workbench

### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora

```bash
sudo yum install scap-workbench
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install scap-workbench
```

## Step 3: Running SCAP Workbench

1. **Launch SCAP Workbench**:
   - You can launch SCAP Workbench from your applications menu or by typing `scap-workbench` in the terminal.

2. **Open a SCAP Content File**:
   - SCAP Workbench comes with preloaded SCAP content. You can open the default content file or download specific SCAP content files from the internet.
   - Click on `File` -> `Open SCAP Content File` and select an appropriate file. For example, on CentOS, you can find the SCAP content in `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-centos7-ds.xml`.

3. **Select a Profile**:
   - SCAP content files usually contain multiple profiles. Choose a profile that matches the security standard you want to audit against. For example, you can choose the `PCI-DSS` profile.

4. **Run the Scan**:
   - Click on `Scan` -> `Scan Remote Machine` or `Scan Local Machine` depending on where you want to run the audit.
   - For a local scan, you can proceed directly. For a remote scan, you need to provide the necessary SSH credentials and connection details.

5. **Review the Results**:
   - Once the scan is complete, SCAP Workbench will display a detailed report of the findings.
   - You can review the results to see which configurations are compliant and which are not. The tool provides detailed information on each finding and suggests remediation steps.

## Step 4: Interpreting the Results

- **Pass**: The configuration complies with the selected profile.
- **Fail**: The configuration does not comply with the selected profile.
- **Unknown**: The scanner couldn't determine the compliance status.

Each finding will have an associated identifier (like CCE, CVE, etc.) and a description of what is wrong and how to fix it. For example, if a rule checks for the presence of a firewall and it’s not found, it will show as failed and provide instructions to install and configure the firewall.

## Step 5: Remediating the Issues

1. **Manual Remediation**:
   - Follow the remediation steps provided in the SCAP Workbench report to manually fix the issues.

2. **Automated Remediation**:
   - OpenSCAP can generate remediation scripts. In SCAP Workbench, you can click on `Generate Remediation Script` to create a script that can be run to automatically fix the issues.

## Conclusion

Using OpenSCAP and SCAP Workbench, you can efficiently perform configuration audits to ensure your systems comply with security standards. Regularly running these audits and remediating the findings helps in maintaining a secure and compliant environment.
